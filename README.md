# **Project Title**
##### This repo contains the code and files necessary to build the "***project name***" <br/>
##### Youtube tutorial: https://youtube.com/ <br/>
##### For this project, you should have a drill, a dremel, a metal file set (optional), and a soldering iron <br/>
#

### **USAGE:**<br/>
The top left button starts games
The bottom left button switches the pico into "low-power" mode (disables display and turns cpu clock frequency down 5x)
To switch the Pico back into normal mode, hold the low power button, then press the right button, then press the top button
The four right buttons operate the games

### **CODE:**<br/>
**sh1106.py:** Driver for display, code can be found at https://github.com/robert-hh/SH1106 <br/>
**main.py:** All of the code that isn't the driver. Handles games, menu, battery capacity, etc. <br/>
